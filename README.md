# File-Handling-and-Exception-Handling-Assignment
File Read & Write Challenge with Error Handling
Description

This Python program demonstrates how to read a file, modify its content, and write it to a new file. It also includes error handling to manage situations when the file does not exist or cannot be accessed.

Features

Prompts the user for a filename.

Reads the file content safely.

Modifies the content (example: converts text to uppercase).

Writes the modified content to a new file.

Handles errors gracefully (FileNotFoundError, IOError, other exceptions).

How to Run

Ensure Python is installed on your computer.

Place the program in the same directory as your text files.

Run the program:

python file_read_write.py


Enter the filename when prompted.

The modified file will be created with the name: modified_<original_file_name>.

Example
Enter the name of the file to read: example.txt
Modified content written to modified_example.txt
